species were solved by cryo-
EM in various states of translation, at close
to atomic resolutions: canine (Voorhees and
Hegde 2016), porcine (Voorhees et al. 2013,
2014), and human (Khatter et al. 2015).

A number of studies focused on translation
mediated by IRESs from viruses on ribosomes
fromyeast (Fernándezetal.2014;Abeyrathneet
al. 2016; Murray et al. 2016), rabbit (Hashem et
al. 2013c; Yamamoto et al. 2014, 2015; Muhs
et al. 2015), and human (Quade et al. 2015).
