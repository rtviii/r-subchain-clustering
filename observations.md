# Notes

- 90% of clustering takes place between 2 and 4 angstrom.
- Excluding  mitochondria and chloroplasts.
- 90% nomenclature coverage except for underdetermined molecules. The rest 10% are  ambiguous pfam groups and such.

#### So it goes:

1. Get your ```.cif``` model ready.
2. Pipe your rnas from post-pfam *pdbid* profile and construct a neighbour tree for a given **GLOBAL PARAMETER** *radius* excluding those *rna*s.
3. Reduce neighbour tree to clusters of neighbours. **HAS TO BE MADE RECURSIVE**.
4. Save to file.
5. Iterate (1-4) for radii in range 1.5-8 angstrom to see full range of clustering.



### Arbitrary Choices:

- Particular radius-sample for each of the species when constructing inside-kingdom correlation matrices(different tightness across species)
- Nomenclature

### More Potential Targets:
